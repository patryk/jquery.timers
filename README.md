jquery.timers
=============

jQuery Timers is a high level abstraction of setTimeout and setInterval. It links into the jQuery chain so you can apply timers to elements directly in your code, leading to much more intuitive timer-based code. It also adds numerous advanced features such as labelling of timers and abstracted timer ids.
